#REACH A PRO
## My first group project in development!

###SUMMARY

This project was an idea that meant to connect experts in a field to people practicing a skill. It was the Capstone for a Ruby on Rails coding bootcamp I attended in 2015. It was never finished as the bootcamp was completed and participants went their own separate ways. It was a great experience! I was able to practice RESTful web-app fundamentals. In addition, I learned the fundamentals of contributing to a group project using github.

This project uses Ruby on Rails and Postgresql.
